Stereo hot-keys mode

RV has an un-documented supplementary "stereo hotkeys" mode in which an additional set of stero-related hotkeys are active.   You enter or leave the mode with Alt-s (Option-s on Mac).  While the mode is active, these additional hotkeys are available:

a  Anaglyph Mode
d  Checked Mode
k  Scanline Mode
s  Side-by-Side Mode
p  Side-by-Side Stereo Mode
m  Mirrored Side-by-Side Stereo Mode
x  Stereo Mode Off (DEPRECATED -- use alt-s (or option-s on the mac))
h  Hardware Stereo Mode
,  Left Eye Only Stereo Mode
.  Right Eye Only Stereo Mode
<  Left Eye Only Stereo Mode
>  Right Eye Only Stereo Mode
S  Swap Eyes
o  Edit Global Relative Stereo Offset

As of RV 3.10.2, we've added these hotkeys to the list above:

z  Horizontal Squeezed Stereo Mode
v  Vertical Squeezed Stereo Mode
r  Edit Global Right-Eye Stereo Offset

As of RV 3.12.11, we added a hotkey to turn stereo off,  especially useful in Presentation Mode:

f  Turn OFF Stereo Display Mode (in Controller Window)

As of RV 3.12.15, we changed the hotkey to turn stereo off, since "f" conflicts with frame. We also added "/" to reset stereo offsets:

O  Turn OFF Stereo Display Mode (in Controller Window)
/  Reset Stereo Offsets

As of RV 3.12.19, we added a couple hotkeys to control the per-clip (per-source) stereo offset:

c  Edit Source/Clip Stereo Offset
R  Edit Source/Clip Right-Eye-Only Stereo Offset
